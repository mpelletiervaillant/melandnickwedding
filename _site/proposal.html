          <p class="black intro-paragraph">After a 2 year wait we finally got to see Hamilton at the NAC. To say I was excited is an understatement (to give you an idea, I know all the lyrics to My Shot)! </p>
          <p class="black intro-paragraph">It was a Thursday, and usually I work from home on that day. But Nick convinced me that it would be easier if we both went to the office so I could walk over to the NAC and he could meet me there. Makes sense, right? </p>
          <p class="black intro-paragraph">We had a great dinner then made our way to the theatre. I was so happy just to be there (as you can tell by the tears). The show ended and we made our way home.  </p>

          <img class="img-flex push" src="images/story-hamilton-pose.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="black intro-paragraph">When we pulled in, I thought I saw light inside but didn’t think anything of it. It’s only when I approached the door did I notice candles and flower petals lined the staircase. That’s when the realization of what was happening hit me and I started crying. But not like cute, happy tears, I mean BAWLING.</p>
          <p class="black intro-paragraph">Nick guided me inside, and up the stairs. When we reached the top I saw the Will you marry me? sign on the counter and he got down on one knee. IT WAS PERFECT!</p>

          <p class="black intro-paragraph">I lied.</p>
          <p class="black intro-paragraph">After dropping her off at work, I didn’t go to the office. I went home to set everything up. I turned them all on and I left. When I picked her up I kept thinking she had no idea this was coming.  At dinner, I was playing it cool loving the fact that she didn’t know what was happening.</p>

          <p class="black intro-paragraph">I was surprised by how much I liked the show.  After the show was done, I knew there was no backing out now.  So we drove home and no matter how much I was rehearsing what I was going to say in my head, my mind was a blank. I got down on one knee and blurted out whatever I could. For some reason she still said yes.</p>
